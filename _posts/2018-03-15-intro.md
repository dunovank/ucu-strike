## What is happening?

Over 42,000 University staff at 64 Universities are on stike. This means that they are not working, and won't be paid for days they miss work.

## Why are University staff striking?

Short answer: Because of proposed changes to the pension scheme, called USS, which covers many University staff, particularly those at older UK Universities.
