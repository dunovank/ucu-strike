## Who is in dispute

* UUK - Universities UK, a body which represents Universities, and the pension fund (USS) which Universities and their employees pay into

* UCU - The University & College Union, the trade-union representing University staff

* Vice Chancellors (and other titles) - the heads of individual Universities and colleges where staff are striking. These people are members of UUK, but may not agree with the position it has taken.

* Individual staff, lecturers and non-teaching staff who are at Universities covered by the USS pension (at some Universities most staff are in a different pension scheme, so at these Universities these staff are not on strike, even though they are represented by the UCU).

* Students, undergraduate, master and PhD students are all effected

* UK government, including pensions regulator - changes to pension schemes can be caused by changes to government policy on pensions, and any changes to pensions must be acceptable to the pension regulator
